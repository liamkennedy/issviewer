			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>ISS Viewer is a free app that makes spotting the International Space Station very easy. It predicts ISS passes and displays them on a map. All you have to do is look at the sky at the right time to see it! The <a href="https://github.com/pkrasicki/issviewer">source code is available on Github</a>. It was created, because of a lack of beginner friendly web apps for spotting the ISS.</p>
			<p>ISS is so far away, so why it is visible from Earth? It's a big object and it reflects a lot of light. So much light that it can be a lot brighter than any star on the night sky. That's why you don't need a telescope to see it.</p>

			<p>ISS Viewer uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set">TLE data</a> to calculate ISS position and predict passes.</p>
